# 🐟 Fish Species Classification using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system for identifying fish species from images.  
We developed this as part of our college mini project, leveraging **MobileNetV2** as the base CNN model.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- 📚 **Dataset**: 9,000 images across 9 fish species provided by **Azmir University, Turkey**
- 🧠 **Model**: MobileNetV2-based transfer learning model with custom classification layers
- 🎯 **Test Accuracy**: Achieved **100% test accuracy**
- 📈 Included performance metrics: **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- 📊 Training and validation loss/accuracy graphs for visualization (in notebook file)

The dataset consists of 9 fish classes:

'Black Sea Sprat': 0
'Gilt-Head Bream': 1
'Hourse Mackerel': 2
'Red Mullet': 3
'Red Sea Bream': 4
'Sea Bass': 5
